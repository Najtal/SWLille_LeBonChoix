We will only provide the information they need to deliver the service, and they are\\n			prohibited from using that information for any other purpose.\\n		\\n		\\n			where f6s wants to keep you up to date on the latest service announcements, updates or other\\n			f6s information\\n		\\n		\\n			where you have given us permission to share your information with third parties\\n		\\n		\\n			f6s will also disclose your personal information if required to do so by law in urgent\\n			circumstances, to protect personal safety, the public or our website.\\n		\\n	\\n	\\n		f6s offers social networking features so you can interact with our partners and with other people using\\n		f6s. The default setting for your profile will be to share your name, profile photo, affiliations, key events,\\n		profile descriptions, public information from an external service you have provided and key contacts\\n		publicly. Content on any private discussion board will only be available to leaders, members and mentors\\n		of that group, unless you indicate otherwise. Additionally, if you choose to make anonymized information\\n		regarding you available to a third party by expressly indicating your preference on the site, we will make\\n		such information available. You can revoke access to your profile or remove the ability to message you\\n		(as applicable) at any time by using the relevant features to leave a specific group, leave a specific\\n		company, hide your profile or retract a mentor/similar relationship. Regardless of the default setting,\\n		we will provide you with a setting to disable your profile on f6s. Please note that your information may\\n		still be accessible on search engines for a number of days after you have disabled your profile on f6s.\\n		Additionally, it is important to remember the people you share with can always share your information\\n		with others and if you do actions on f6s like making an application, getting a deal or using Instant Apply,\\n		the data you provide may be shared with third parties as required to fulfil your request. Also consider\\n		that if you choose to enable f6s to publish on your behalf to a third party, anything published will be\\n		subject to that third party\'s privacy policy.
